# Raytracing In A Weekend
My run amok of raytracing in a weekend, purely for educational purposes. Cheers!

# How to run
from main directory cd to src
```
~>cd src
```
then run build.bat
```
~\src>build
```
then cd to bin directory and run main.exe
```
~\bin>main.exe
```
this should output image.ppm in the data directory

*I'm practicing developing on Windows so watch out.*
